- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seongjae-lee-23028359/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/seongjaelee)

## Skills
- **Programming Experience**: C++, Google Cloud SQL, Python, TypeScript, Java, C#, JavaScript, Dart, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks and Tools**: Google Dataflow, TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, AngularJS, AngularDart, GWT, jQuery, HavokAI, OpenGL
- **Languages**: English, Korean

## Experience
- **Senior Software Engineer**, Geo Driving Quality, Google, Seattle (2018–Present)
  - Developed and launched an ETA prediction ML model using Graph Neural Networks. This project was a collaboration with DeepMind. The model improved the quality of predictions by up to 50% in highly congested metros ([blog post][2], [paper][1]).
  - Built and maintained several ML pipelines that cover training, evaluating, deploying, serving, logging, and monitoring.
  - Optimized batch pipelines processing petabytes of data using Google Dataflow.
- **Software Engineer**, Cloud Endpoints, Google, Seattle (2017–2018)
  - Developed scalable web pages and components for managing service quotas and usages in AngularJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Java.
  - Built a scalable web page that visualizes API usages for +1000 hierarchical projects.
- **Software Engineer**, AdWords DoubleClick Search, Google, Seattle (2014–2017)
  - Developed scalable web pages and components for ads bidding strategy and bidding state monitoring in GWT, AngularDart, and Java.
  - Designed and developed a budget optimization feature.
  - Built a backend batch job building monthly invoices for customers.
- **Research Assistant**, [Center for Game Science](https://centerforgamescience.org/), University of Washington (2013–2014)
  - Built a ML model predicting individual player behaviors from play history in different educational games without game-specific domain models.
- **Game Developer**, [NCSOFT](https://kr.ncsoft.com/en/index.do), Seoul (2010–2013)
  - Developed a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG).
  - Built a client-side game library handling pathfinding and character animation.
  - Built and refined tools for character animators and game map designers.
- **Research Assistant**, [Graphics and Imaging Laboratory](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/), University of Washington (2007–2010)
  - Researched controlling biped characters with mocap animation data.
  - Used reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to learn data-based biped character controllers.
- **Intern**, Microsoft Research, Redmond (Summer of 2008)
  - Built an animation framework for avatars in a virtual world.
- **Research Assistant** of [Professor Amy Greenwald](http://cs.brown.edu/people/faculty/amy/), Brown University (2005–2007)
  - Worked on trading agents design and analysis.
  - Won in the annual [Trading Agent Competition (TAC)](https://strategicreasoning.org/trading-agent-competition/) with our agent RoxyBot in 2006.
  - Used integer linear programming (ILP) to model competitors, predict bidding prices, and compute the best bidding strategy.
- **Research Assistant**, [Center for Computation & Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu/), Brown University (Summer of 2006)
  - Worked on visualization and user interface for CAVE(CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment), a virtual environment using 3D glasses.
